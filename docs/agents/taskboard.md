# Taskboard

## Current Objective

Implement V1 batch image processing for the WeChat mini-program: users can select up to 9 images, add more images later, manage the selected-image list, enter per-image polaroid counts and rotations, then process each selected image in order and display all extracted polaroids in stable order.

Scope constraints:

- Use the agreed V1 approach: no new batch backend API unless Backend finds a blocker.
- Frontend submits selected images sequentially to the existing `/api/process` single-image task API.
- Preserve token/auth behavior, RunPod startup, SAM/extraction internals, result download auth, and existing single-image behavior.
- Batch result order must be: selected image order, then detected polaroid order inside each image.
- Continue processing later images if one image fails; report partial failures clearly.
- Maximum selected images: 9.

## Current Tasks

| ID | Owner | Status | Task | Files | Acceptance Criteria |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| BATCH-FE-001 | Frontend | done | Replace the single-image selection state with a selected-images list while preserving the existing single-image workflow. | `wechat-miniprogram/pages/index/index.js`, `wechat-miniprogram/pages/index/index.wxml`, `wechat-miniprogram/pages/index/index.wxss`, `docs/agents/handoffs/2026-06-17-frontend-batch-images.md` | Frontend commits `94471d5` through `9865fe4` implement selection up to 9, add-more behavior, and selected-image state. |
| BATCH-FE-002 | Frontend | done | Implement current-image preview management for multiple selected images. | Same Frontend files and same handoff as `BATCH-FE-001` | Frontend implements one large current-image preview, left/right navigation, delete-on-preview, index clamping, and thumbnail strip; UI blockers were resolved by `BATCH-FE-005`. |
| BATCH-FE-003 | Frontend | done | Bind polaroid count and rotation to the current image. | Same Frontend files and same handoff as `BATCH-FE-001` | Reviewer mock checks passed for independent per-image count and rotation state. |
| BATCH-FE-004 | Frontend | done | Process selected images sequentially and aggregate ordered results. | Same Frontend files and same handoff as `BATCH-FE-001` | Reviewer mock checks passed for sequential processing, partial success, all-failed behavior, selected-image order, and task-scoped result keys. |
| BATCH-BE-001 | Backend | done | Audit and verify that the existing single-image backend task API safely supports V1 sequential batch orchestration. | `docs/agents/handoffs/2026-06-17-backend-batch-images.md` | Backend commit `d1af90d` adds a handoff only; no backend code changes. Reviewer confirmed existing API/rate-limit behavior supports normal 9-image sequential batches and no new batch API is needed. |
| BATCH-REV-001 | Reviewer | done | Review the batch image implementation after Frontend and Backend handoffs are available. | Review only; `docs/agents/handoffs/2026-06-17-reviewer-batch-images.md` | Reviewer commit `99e8ba4` verdict: changes requested. Core batch logic and Backend compatibility are acceptable, but Frontend has blocking UI issues. |
| BATCH-FE-005 | Frontend | done | Fix remaining batch UI blockers from Reviewer and user visual feedback. | `wechat-miniprogram/pages/index/index.wxml`, `wechat-miniprogram/pages/index/index.wxss`, `wechat-miniprogram/pages/index/index.js`, `docs/agents/handoffs/2026-06-17-frontend-batch-ui-fixes.md` | Frontend commit `c0f2d39` fixes toolbar button sizing, preview navigation rendering, 9-thumbnail layout, and thumbnail tap-to-jump. |
| BATCH-REV-002 | Reviewer | done | Re-review the batch UI fixes after the Frontend handoff is available. | Review only; `docs/agents/handoffs/2026-06-17-reviewer-batch-ui-fixes.md` | Reviewer commit `bb92d5b` verdict: approved. The two P2 UI findings and the 9-thumbnail tap-to-jump requirement are resolved. |
| BATCH-FE-006 | Frontend | pending | Fix processing-time interaction, interrupt behavior, incremental result display, and batch status text found during user testing. | `wechat-miniprogram/pages/index/index.js`, `wechat-miniprogram/pages/index/index.wxml`, `wechat-miniprogram/pages/index/index.wxss`, `docs/agents/handoffs/YYYY-MM-DD-frontend-batch-processing-ux.md` | During backend processing, thumbnail taps and left/right preview navigation remain usable; while processing, the `添加图片` button is replaced by an `中断` button; interrupting calls the Backend cancel API for the currently active task, stops the current frontend batch flow, prevents later image uploads, stops/ignores further polling results, leaves already received results visible, and shows an interrupted status. Partial polaroid results must appear as soon as they are returned by `/api/status/<task_id>`, preserving the original incremental display behavior instead of waiting for the whole source image to finish. Status text restores target count display `(m/n)` and changes "已提取几张" style wording to "正在提取第几张" while processing. Existing selected-image order, task-scoped result keys, failure-continue behavior, auth, upload headers, result download, save behavior, and contact-author UI remain unchanged. |
| BATCH-BE-002 | Backend | pending | Add backend task cancellation support so the interrupt button terminates the active extraction task. | `backend/app.py`, `docs/agents/handoffs/YYYY-MM-DD-backend-task-cancel.md` | Add a protected cancel endpoint for the existing task model, for example `POST /api/cancel/<task_id>`; queued tasks can be removed or marked canceled; processing tasks are marked cancel-requested and the worker/extraction path checks this state at safe checkpoints so it stops as soon as practical and does not continue extracting additional polaroids after cancellation. Canceled tasks return a clear status such as `canceled`/`cancelled` from `/api/status/<task_id>`; already produced results may remain downloadable until normal TTL; raw data and memory cleanup still happen; auth, RunPod startup, normal processing, status/result response compatibility, and rate limiting remain safe. Backend handoff includes `python -m py_compile backend\app.py` and focused tests for queued cancel, processing cancel flag/status, and unauthorized cancel. |
| CONTACT-BE-002 | Backend | pending | Fix contact-author email observability and ensure optional contact info appears in delivered email body. | `backend/app.py`, `docs/agents/handoffs/YYYY-MM-DD-backend-contact-email-log.md` | `POST /api/contact` with non-empty `contact` must produce an email body that visibly includes the contact info, preferably under a clear label such as `联系方式`; missing/empty contact remains accepted and omitted; backend logs a successful send record with timestamp, recipient or configured destination, client IP, and whether contact info was provided; failure logs remain present; do not log the full message body or sensitive contact value unless explicitly justified; existing route/auth/rate-limit/response shape remains compatible. Backend handoff includes `python -m py_compile backend\app.py` and a focused fake-SMTP test proving contact info is in the message body and success logging occurs. |
| BATCH-REV-003 | Reviewer | pending | Review the processing UX, backend cancellation, and contact email/log fixes after Frontend and Backend handoffs are available. | Review only; write `docs/agents/handoffs/YYYY-MM-DD-reviewer-batch-processing-contact-fixes.md` | Reviewer verifies processing-time thumbnail navigation, interrupt button behavior, Frontend calling Backend cancel for the active task, Backend queued/processing cancel behavior and status, incremental per-polaroid display, restored `(m/n)` / "正在提取第几张" status wording, preserved batch semantics, and contact email/log behavior. Reviewer confirms no unrelated auth, RunPod startup, SAM extraction behavior beyond cancellation checks, contact UI, result download, or save changes. |

## API / Configuration Contract

V1 keeps the existing single-image task API.

Frontend request flow:

- For each selected image, submit one `POST /api/process` request with multipart field `image`.
- Submit images sequentially in selected-image order.
- Include existing form fields per image:
  - `token`
  - `wb`
  - `denoise`
  - `rotation_degrees`
  - optional `expected_polaroids`
  - optional `polaroid_count`
- Poll each returned `task_id` through existing `/api/status/<task_id>`.
- Download each result through existing `/api/result/<task_id>/<result_id>`.

Backend response contract:

- Existing `/api/process` response shape remains compatible.
- Existing `/api/status/<task_id>` fields remain compatible, including `results`, `expected_polaroids`, `total_polaroids`, `warning`, and `extraction_complete`.
- Existing `/api/result/<task_id>/<result_id>` behavior remains compatible.
- No new batch route is required for V1.

Ordering contract:

- Overall display order is selected image order.
- Within each image, display order is backend result order, which should remain the existing detected polaroid order.
- Frontend must use a result key unique across backend tasks, such as `taskId:resultId`, to avoid merging result `0` from different images.

Failure contract:

- A failed upload, failed task, timeout, or empty extraction for one image must not stop later images from processing.
- Final UI must distinguish full success, partial success, and no successful results.
- Interrupting a running batch must cancel the currently active backend task as well as stop the frontend batch flow.
- Frontend must call the Backend cancel endpoint for the active `task_id`, then stop further uploads and ignore/stop polling updates after the user interrupts.
- Backend cancellation should terminate queued tasks immediately and stop processing tasks as soon as practical through explicit cancel state checks; after cancellation it must not continue extracting additional polaroids for that task.
- Frontend must keep incremental result display: results returned during `/api/status/<task_id>` polling should appear immediately, not only after the whole source image completes.

Backend cancellation contract:

- Add a protected task cancellation endpoint for the existing task model, for example `POST /api/cancel/<task_id>`.
- Successful cancellation returns a JSON response compatible with existing frontend request handling, for example `{ "ok": true, "status": "canceled" }`.
- `/api/status/<task_id>` must expose a clear canceled status after cancellation.
- Unauthorized cancel requests must be rejected the same way as other protected `/api/*` routes.

Contact email contract:

- `POST /api/contact` keeps the existing route, auth, rate limit, and response shape.
- Optional `contact` must be included in the email body when provided and omitted when empty.
- Backend must log successful contact email sends as well as failures.

## Decisions

| Date | Decision | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-06-16 | Use V1 sequential orchestration on top of existing single-image `/api/process`. | Avoids a larger backend batch-task redesign and keeps extraction internals stable. |
| 2026-06-16 | Limit selected images to 9. | Keeps upload volume within WeChat and backend rate-limit constraints for the first batch version. |
| 2026-06-16 | Bind count input and rotation state to the current image. | User explicitly requested per-image counts and rotations while previewing one image at a time. |
| 2026-06-16 | Tapping an already selected preview should offer delete only. | User explicitly changed the preview tap behavior from replace to delete. |
| 2026-06-16 | Continue after individual image failures and preserve ordered successful results. | Provides useful partial output for long batches and matches the agreed V1 behavior. |
| 2026-06-17 | Route remaining batch work to Frontend UI only. | Reviewer approved core batch logic and Backend compatibility, while all open blockers are display/navigation issues in the mini-program UI. |
| 2026-06-17 | Thumbnail strip must show all 9 selected images and support tap-to-jump. | User added this visual requirement after review; it belongs with the same Frontend UI fix. |
| 2026-06-17 | Interrupt must cancel the active backend extraction task, not just frontend orchestration. | User explicitly clarified that the interrupt button should terminate the backend task currently extracting. |
| 2026-06-17 | Preserve incremental polaroid display during batch processing. | User expects the original behavior where each returned polaroid appears as soon as the backend reports it. |
| 2026-06-17 | Reopen Backend contact-email work for delivered contact info and success logs. | User testing found optional contact info is not visible in the email and successful sends are not logged. |

## Open Questions

- None. The new user-tested issues have concrete Frontend and Backend owners.
